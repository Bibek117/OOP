/*Write a program to create class Figure with dim1 and dim2 as data members and constructor to
initialize its data. Create derived class called Triangle and define a member function Area() in it
to calculate the area of triangle. Create another class called Rectangle derived from Figure and
define member function Area() to calculate the area of rectangle. Implement this program using run time polymorphism*/
